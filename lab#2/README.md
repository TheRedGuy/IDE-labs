Conclusion
----------

This laboratory work was quite interesting, and importaint, because it forces to think about multi-tier architecture.  
Developing a business (logic) module, independent from the GUI module, is a powerful technique.  
This allows reusing the logic module in different applications, implemented with different technologies.
