Conclusion
----------

This laboratory work was the most interesting, because it gave me the posibility to develop a mobile application from scratch, that is actually quite useful. 
Pomodoro technique is ment to boost one's productivity, and I learned quite a lot developing this app. 
Also, I wanted to study iOS development a long time ago, and this laboratory work gave me the additional motivation to do so.

Be productive, with Pomodoro and my app! :)
